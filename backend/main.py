This suggests the presence of a fluid-filled sac, which is typically benign and may not cause symptoms. Ultrasound imaging uses sound waves to create real-time visuals of internal organs and is effective in detecting such abnormalities. While most cysts are harmless, a follow-up consultation with a healthcare professional is recommended to evaluate its size, nature, and whether further investigation is needed.

Gliomas are tumors that originate in the glial cells of the brain or spinal cord. They can affect brain function depending on their location, size, and growth rate, potentially causing symptoms such as headaches, seizures, or neurological changes.

                MRI scans are highly effective for detecting such tumors, as they offer detailed images of soft brain tissues. This allows for accurate visualization of the tumor's structure and position, which is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning.

                Although this result indicates a strong likelihood of Glioma, it is not a confirmed medical diagnosis. You should consult a neurologist or oncologist for further evaluation. Additional tests like a contrast-enhanced MRI or biopsy may be recommended to validate the finding.
